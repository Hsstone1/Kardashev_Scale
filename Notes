Game Info

	GameSpeed should max out at 100x default with a logarithmic gain when civ_1 is unlocked
	similar to how egg inc increases prestige eggs but much slower


	Have 'boss' tiles which allow the learning of a new technological age
		Have several images that have glowing lines that connect each upgrade from the main tech age upgrade
			If the user has not unlocked an age yet, then the background is greyed out similar to egg inc, and you cannot see what is .
		Have other tiles give access to upgrades, and use energy to purchase it
